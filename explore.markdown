  Title: Stamford
  Description: It is known for its castle, although Oakham Castle is not actually
    a castle but a Norman manor house built between 1180-1190. It is thought to be
    one of the finest examples of late 12th century architecture in England. The Great
    Hall still remains intact today and is still used for occasional crown courts
    and for weddings. Having just received a substantial grant from the Heritage Lottery
    Fund it is well worth a visit. Admission is free  – check the website for opening
    times www.rutland.gov.uk

Rutland is a beautiful and often overlooked county due to it’s size. It is the smallest county in England but with such a lot to offer it’s visitors. Known as Multum in Parvo (Much in Little) it certainly lives up to its name.
