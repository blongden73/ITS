# Arriving
The Hudnalls Hideout treehouse is off the beaten track so it takes a little more effort to get here but your effort will be rewarded, we promise.

The Hudnalls Hideout has a narrow access track from a single track country lane to the car parking area.

The narrowest point is 2.3 meters wide. Please drive slowly and carefully on the track (maximum speed 5mph) and be considerate of neighbouring properties on your arrival and departure from the site. Be mindful that walkers with dogs and wild animals, specifically wild deer, also use the
track.

Please note the access track is unsuitable for low slung sports cars or very large 4×4 / vans or campervans.

We will ask you at the time of booking for the make and model of vehicle you intend to arrive in and notify you if we have any concerns regarding access.

The car parking area is level and gravelled.

There is a short mostly downhill walk (approx. 150m) with a wheelbarrow across the wild flower meadow (on mown grass paths) and a woodland track to get to the treehouse. The terrain is a mixture of grass and stone gravelled track so the terrain is unlevel and suitable footwear will be required.

Please note there is no pathway lighting to the treehouse from the car parking area. A rechargeable torch is provided for your convenience and we encourage guests to arrive before dark for this reason.

The treehouse is self-check-in. We provide a easy-to-follow map to find the treehouse.

# Access to the Treehouse
The treehouse is approached via a hard-stoned woodland track leading to the entrance ramp – a moderately sloping wooden ramped walkway (92cms wide), to the front entrance door. The front door is 74cms wide and there is a 4.5cm (approx) raised door threshold. This doorway goes straight into the kitchen/dining area.

The ground floor is open-plan on the same level with wood flooring. It contains a small kitchen area with sink, open shelves, storage cupboards, fridge, two ring induction hob, toaster oven, and dishwasher (there is no main oven) and dining area with a table and two chairs.

The lounge area has a 2 seater sofa, arm chair, side tables, and a suspended bioethanol fireplace. The lounge has large 3.2m wide bi-fold doors out onto the elevated deck area. The doors have a raised door runner threshold (approx 3cms deep).

On the ground floor, there is also a wet room with a double size walk-in rainfall shower, vanity unit with sink and flushing WC.

An electric boiler provides instant hot water and electricity is provided to various lights and sockets. Two sockets have USB chargers.

The ground floor has underfloor heating throughout.

There is no TV or Wi-Fi. Good 4G phone coverage on most networks outside, more limited reception inside due to the high level of modern insulation.

The bedroom is located on a mezzanine floor above the lounge reached via a curved handmade staircase with handrails. The stairs has 11 steps and the staircase is 86cms wide). The kingsize bed (2mx1.5m) is a loft-style platform (33cms from the floor) with a medium firm spring and memory foam luxury mattress. This bedroom area has a side velux window (electronically opening) and a floor to ceiling triangular window looking out onto the woodland. People with severe vertigo may not find this bedroom suitable.

There is a small landing area with a vanity shelf and mirror and space for luggage. There is reduced head height due to the sloping roof eves.

From the large raised deck area, there is a narrow spiral staircase with a handrail (13 steps) down to ground level, to access the fire pit and BBQ area. There is a woodchip path with small wooden steps to the fire pit area. There is an alternative route down a moderate slope from the treehouse entrance ramp. The fire pit has natural tree stump seats and a small cable drum table with a natural fire pit circle and BBQ grill rack.

# The Grounds
The treehouse is located in a private 2 acre woodland. Guests have exclusive access to this area but we strongly advise that you stick to the pathways provided and for your safety wear appropriate footwear suitable for grass and woodland tracks that can be wet and muddy at all times of the year.

The wild flower meadow is native grassland and contains many rare local flowers and grasses. It is also home to bees and butterflies. Grass tracks are mown in the meadow as natural walkways, please try to walk on these to conserve the wild flower meadow habitat. These grass pathways can be uneven and slippery, when it has rained or heavy dew has formed.
